CAITLINS BIO

With a deep concern for the human condition, Caitlin followed her interest in Religion Studies and
has traveled extensively around the world. From 2011-2012, she worked to bring the rights of women
to the forefront of decision making for the largest coffee trading company in East Africa.

While active in promoting community-based, social-enterprise initiatives along the Dominican/Haitian
border she has also worked to develop COTEDEMI, a grassroots women's organization that provides
culturally and linguistically sensitive programs focused on business development and financial planning
and facilitates weekly meetings that emphasize the importance of savings to secure legal documentation needed to
live, work and travel safely in the Dominican Republic.

Understanding the needs that would enable COTEDEMI's growth, Caitlin began working as a consultant
to develop and coordinate projects and products for ADOPEM (a Dominican bank founded by women to
serve the needs of women), including core-development of their "Banca Comunal" product which enables
undocumented women access to financial services. As the key connecting force to unite the efforts of
ADOPEM and COTEDEMI, she facilitated the first pilot group of undocumented individuals living on the
border to receive loans through "Banca Comunal" To date the groups have received and are paying back
over USD $10,000 in loans.

Caitlin is active in domestic and international projects and initiatives to promote economic
development, as well as documentaries on gender and immigration challenges. She loves the mountains
and has climbed to Mt Everest Base Camp and Island Peak, Nepal. She is a certified yoga instructor
and is diligently working to enhance the quality of the human condition through the creation of a
wellness center that integrates massage therapy, meditation, and yoga.
